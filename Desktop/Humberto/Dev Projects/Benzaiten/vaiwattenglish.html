<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vaiwatt is Vaiwatt is Vaiwatt.<br><br>

    Vaiwatt is a Tokyo-based band formed in 2013, known for blending punk-pop and grunge into a vibrant technicolor aesthetic. 
    The core members are KEN (vocals and guitar) and TAMA (bass and vocals). Their music reflects a deep respect for 20th-century rock, 
    with KEN's songwriting drawing from his super fucked up childhood experiences, creating a fusion of purity and conflict. Visually, 
    Vaiwatt incorporates　elements of manga, Kabuki makeup, and almost cyberpunk fashion, crafting a unique Japanese rock style. 
    "Ken the rock clown" as he calls himself truly　has a larger-than-life personality, equally matched by the vibrant Tama.<br><br>


    The band made its television debut at Japan's oldest rock festival, the New Year World Rock Festival, from 2014 to 2015. 
    They have since organized numerous sold-out shows in Japan and initiated independent projects like "napaJ興行," a fundraising event 
    supporting victims of the Great East Japan Earthquake from 2014 to 2016. Proceeds were donated to "After-School/Collabo-schools" in the 
    affected areas. Currently, part of their proceeds aid recent earthquake-stricken regions in Turkey, Kumamoto, and the Noto Peninsula in 
    Japan. Internationally, Vaiwatt has toured extensively, performing in the United States, Russia, Italy, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. 
    Since 2021, they have organized the international music festival "EDO WAVE" in Tokyo, bringing global talent to Japan. Here is a look at 
    one of their singles:<br><br>

    <br><br>

    Their discography includes the album "BEST," released in 2017, and singles like "Yellow Goblins", "FUUGA.", and "なんでそんなVACANT". 
    Vaiwatt's unique blend of musical styles and cultural influences has garnered them a dedicated following both in Japan and 
    internationally.<br><br>

    I see them as a dynanic duo keeping the free spirit of punk alive in a time where such a lifestyle has been discarded by the average
    youth, in favor of digital, faceless love.
