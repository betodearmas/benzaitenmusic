    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northern Pele - Hard to talk about someone you know so little about, especially when Googling them mostly returns clips of Pel√© or of 
        Key and Peele..<br><br>
        
        I saw them first at a venue called 7th Floor in the heart of Shibuya when I myself was playing there earlier that day. They were the headliners, and it's easy 
        to understand why. They are fun, melancholy, fear, acceptance, and so much more, in sonic form (7th floor has lots of good bands it seems).
        <br><br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their arrangement is fluid, since both times I saw them they had some different members. So I can't say for certain that the 
        performance I saw is the one and <i>only</i> Northern Pele. There are many bands that combine acoustic with electric with brass with keys, but what really got 
        me into these guys was the lyrics of one particular song (the name of which I sadly can't recall right now) but that song, as I was standing in a half-full hall, 
        off to the side, inconspicuously watching, made me literally shed a tear. It was, of course, a sad love song about letting go, and that we should rejoice at the 
        fact that it happened, and not be sad because it's over.<br><br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, not all the songs are sad. Most of them are cheerful, irish pub, ska-type, happy-go-lucky tunes, which is awesome when all 
        the musicians are on lock, and killing it. The rhythmic acoustic guitar blends perfectly with the rest, while still somehow maintaining a lead guitar feel. 
        Not least because the lead singer has maxed out charisma (notwithstanding this extremely flattering cover image), but also their lyrics are just uplifting, 
        backed up with beaufitul instrumentals. Tokyo's very own Belle & Sebastian. Here is a little clip of them playing at Shibuya NOB - probably the smallest stage 
        in Shibuya, but brought to life by these giants:

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, Northern Pele are like that cute girl at the festival that you talk to for 5 minutes, never to be seen again, but to be 
            forever remembered. Indeed, they don't play too often. I myself have only seen them twice in the last three years (granted, I have missed too many of their 
            shows) but still, they really don't play too often. Nevertheless, they made a huge impression of me. I admit, I cry easily, but usually at movies, and rarely, 
            if ever, at a gig. But I tell you, I was standing there and I shed a tear. Even if you are not an emotional person, it'd be worth to open yourself up to 
            Northern Pele. I don't believe they have released any music yet, so your only chance to listen to them is to go see them live!
