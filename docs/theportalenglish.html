<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Portal is a Tokyo-based band that originated as a lo-fi recording project by Uk's Lyle Marsden and Japan's Nobuki Watanabe. They got started focusing on home recordings, and then they expanded their lineup with support members for live performances in Tokyo. Their music is characterized by a heavy use of synthesizers, creating a sound that blends elements of psychedelic and new wave genres. The band is known for its flexibility, adjusting its performance setup to suit different environments, ranging from full-band arrangements to more intimate configurations. They have plans to release an EP in the spring, and have already released 2 songs. Here is a glimpse at their live performance of the song "Snowball":<br><br>

    I think Lyle and Nobuki are super creative songwriters, in the way that they make seemingly simple riffs and progressions that are actually very intricate. Odd times, odd changes, and a real back-to-basics approach that is actually quite technical and refreshingly interesting. This is evident in songs like "Buddy of Mine" (not out yet) and "Self Made Bed". That tasteful, thick mix of washy guitars and keys with a thumping bass and drums makes for a super contrasting but enticing blend of sounds.<br><br>

    Nobuki has also recently started to gain traction in the DJ space, spinning deep house until 6 am at least once a week. I guess The Portal is what happens when you combine a singer-songwriter like Lyle with a musical chameleon like Nobuki. I hope they put out their LP soon. I for one can't wait to hear it!
