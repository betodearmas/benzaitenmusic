    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ModernOld: Tokyo's Genre-Defying Electronic Dance Rock Duo<br><br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emerging from Japan's vibrant music scene, ModernOld is an electronic dance rock duo that has been captivating audiences with their eclectic sound and dynamic performances. Formed in May 2024, 
        the duo comprises Ryutaro Kawakami (bass and vocals) from Ehime Prefecture and Godai Nagao (beats and guitar) from Tokushima Prefecture. Their music seamlessly blends influences from British rock legends 
        like The Beatles and Oasis with a myriad of other genres, resulting in a versatile and danceable style that defies traditional categorization.​
        <br><br>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 2024, ModernOld released their debut single, "Turn On (Pt.1&2)," a six-minute track that showcases their ability to fuse electronic beats with rock instrumentation. This release was 
        followed by their self-titled first album in May 2024, further establishing their presence in the Japanese music landscape. Their genre-fluid approach and commitment to creating "danceable music" 
        have garnered them a diverse fanbase.​<br><br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond their musical endeavors, the members have unique personal interests that add depth to their artistic personas. Kawakami is known for his passion for stone collecting, while Nagao has a 
        deep affection for animals. These individual pursuits contribute to the duo's distinctive identity within the music industry.​ Here is a clip of them playing their song "90's dancefloor":
